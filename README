Overview
--------
The N++CR Function Tracer programmers tool allows the developer to
mark functions to trace while running the Debug build of N++CR.
The marked functions are added to categories which can then be
enabled and disabled as a group.

This repository is a collection of such categories.  These category
files could have been added to the main repository of N++CR within a
folder that had a .gitignore, but then developers would need to mess
with ignoring particular personal category.h files that they did not
want to share yet.  By creating this repo, the developer is free to
keep their own revisions and branches of the categories without
polluting the N++CR working tree they are debugging.  When ready, the
category can be shared and available to all.


Usage
-----
To enable or disable any category just run

	contrib/nppcr-debug-setup.bat

from your root npp-community repository.  Then edit the

	nppcr-debug/nppcr-debug-active.h

file to your liking.


File Structure
--------------
The 'core' folder contains categories that are specific to a
particular well defined class or file.

The 'contrib' folder contains any other tracked category groups.

The 'private' folder is, by default, an ignored folder.

Have fun!
